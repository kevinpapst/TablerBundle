## How it was made

3 pre-implemented layouts are available for the `reset-password` form.

There are inspired by `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle@1.11`.
See here: https://github.com/SymfonyCasts/reset-password-bundle

Filenames and variables/forms name follows what `reset-password-bundle` as generated by default.
You can of course override everything if needed.

## Using the layout

In order to use the layouts, 
you should extend the one you want from `@Tabler/security/reset_password/`:
- check-email.html.twig
- request.html.twig
- reset.html.twig

Here's an example for the reset request form with the email input.
```twig
{% extends '@Tabler/security/reset_password/request.html.twig' %}

{% block logo_login %}
    <a href="." class="navbar-brand navbar-brand-autodark">
        <img src="{{ asset('images/logo.svg') }}" height="36">
    </a>
{% endblock %}
```

### Extra

You shouldn't directly extend `@Tabler\security\reset_password\base.html.twig`, 
it's only there to emptying the `login_social_auth` block, and add the flash errors.

If you want to make your own template with that base, you can.
