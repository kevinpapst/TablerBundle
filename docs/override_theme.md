# Override theme

You can find a model to override the default theme of Tabler in the file [theme.scss](https://github.com/kevinpapst/TablerBundle/blob/main/docs/theme.scss).

This is a light example, it can be customized according to your requirement.

In this example, it allows you to:
1. Use custom font:
   1. Hind
   2. Montserrat
2. Redefine all default colors:
   1. primary
   2. secondary
   3. ...
   4. success
   5. warning
   6. ...

## Next steps

Please go back to the [Tabler bundle documentation](index.md) to find out more about using the theme.
